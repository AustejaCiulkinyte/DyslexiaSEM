Munging file: ADHD_clean.tsv
Found an NEFF column for sample size. 

Please note that this is likely effective sample size and should only be used for liability h^2 conversion for binary traits and that it should reflect the sum of effective sample sizes across cohorts.

Be aware that some NEFF columns reflect half of the effective sample size; the function will automatically double the column names if recognized [check above in .log file to determine if this is the case].
If the Neff value is halved in the summary stats, but not recognized by the munge function, this should be manually doubled prior to running munge.
Interpreting the SNP column as the SNP column.
Interpreting the A1 column as the A1 column.
Interpreting the A2 column as the A2 column.

Interpreting the P column as the P column.
Interpreting the NEFF column as the N column.
Interpreting the MAF column as the MAF column.
Interpreting the SE column as the SE column.
